<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Kevin Campbell, I'm a Father of 4 loving kids and a loving wife, every day I wake up thinking about how I can improve their lives and the lives of everyone around me.
   I worked 5 years in Information Technology as a Network Security Administrator.
    I was approached by my mentor Mark Connelly a Cyber Security Architect about working on building a company together on coloring books.</p>

<p>After a year of working in retail outside of IT I decided to agree to work building Mahomet Coloring Book (MCB) as the Web Developer,
   After working in WP and designing the web page for our company I knew I wanted to become a Full stack web developer.
    For the next year I would be working in Udemy on "the complete full-stack web development bootcamp " made by Dr. Angela Yu , Developer and lead instructor. </p>
